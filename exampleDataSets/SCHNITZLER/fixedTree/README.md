# Analyses of the dataset from Schnitzler et al. (2017). Evolutionary Ecology Research.

This is the model selection study with a fixed tree.

Each folder reproduces the analysis with a different MCC tree, obtained with
one of the models run in the `totalEvidence` folder (no trait, BM, OU).

Each analysis is run on the full tree (with fossils) or the tree trimmed to
present taxa only (no fossil).

On each tree, the various evolution models presented in the manuscript are run,
with marginal likelihood estimation.
