# Analyses of the dataset from Schnitzler et al. (2017). Evolutionary Ecology Research.

This is the total evidence approach, where the tree and the continuous trait
process are inferred simultaneously. 

`xml_files_2019-09-19` contains the `xml` files to fit the various models
described in the manuscript with BEAST (without the continuous traits, or with
a BM or a diagonal OU to model them).
